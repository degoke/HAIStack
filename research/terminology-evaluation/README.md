# Track D — Terminology mapping quality and provenance

Gold-standard ConceptMap plus quality metrics and an audit-backed provenance
model for translations that affect validation or analytics.

## Reproduce

```bash
make research-terminology
go test ./research/terminology-evaluation -count=1
go run ./research/terminology-evaluation/cmd
```

## Gold set

[`testdata/conceptmap.json`](./testdata/conceptmap.json) is a synthetic
ConceptMap (`http://haistack.dev/research/ConceptMap/lab-to-panel|1.0.0`)
from a toy lab CodeSystem to a toy panel CodeSystem. Codes are **not**
SNOMED CT or LOINC — they exist so the artefact can be redistributed without
terminology licenses.

[`testdata/cases.json`](./testdata/cases.json) lists source codes and the
expected equivalence class:

| Class | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `exact` | equivalent / equal |
| `narrow` | source is broader than target (narrower result) |
| `broad` | source is narrower than target (wider result) |
| `unmatched` | no acceptable translation (unmatched, disjoint, noMap) |

## Metrics

The scorer reports counts and rates for exact / narrow / broad / unmatched,
plus **provenance completeness**: share of attempted translations that record
ConceptMap URL+version, source CodeSystem version, and timestamp.

Each translation is also appended as a `terminology.translate` audit event
(`pkg/audit.LogTerminologyTranslate`).

## Finite ValueSet expansion

`pkg/terminology` expands only finite compose/expansion members. Unbounded
intensional ValueSets, missing global-catalog opt-in, and remote-only codes
are expected gaps: the gold set documents unmatched codes rather than
pretending local expansion is complete.
